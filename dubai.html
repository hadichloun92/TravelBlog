    <p>This is a little tricky because much of it is personal taste.
         There are some hugely luxurious coastal resort hotels for holidaymakers 
         but there are also thousands of options within the different areas of the city and on The Creek.
         It really depends on what you want to get out of your trip. Dubai hotels certainly come in the luxury
         category and budget hotels in Dubai are, not so budget as elsewhere.
         For the ultimate Dubai experience, try looking at Atlantis the Palm or Burj al Arab on Jumeira Beach, 
         you’ll need a fat wallet but it would be an experience never to forget.
         Did you know The Atlantis has water rides, shark encounters, a teen and kids club and more? 
         This is a bucket list item to tick off, check it out at our link above.
         We tend to go for apartment-style hotels for stopovers of a few days. They include kitchens and 
         washing machines, which makes life easier. They are towards the more budget-friendly end.

         The Golden Sands series of apartment hotels in Bur Dubai are popular and usually have swimming pools.  
         They are away from the coast but in a central area. We’ve stayed at a couple of their apartment hotels and they’ve been pretty good value.
         
         Consider transport options. As a family of four, we generally find taxis are easier and cheaper than the Dubai metro. 
         If you’re not sticking to a tight budget, luxury cars and transfers are easy to arrange.</p>
