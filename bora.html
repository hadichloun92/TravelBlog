    <p>Bora Bora is hands down the most romantic and beautiful destination in the world!
         It has rightfully earned the title of paradise and ultimate honeymoon destination. 
         My husband and I spent 9 days exploring French Polynesia and Bora Bora was the best 
         part of the trip. In this blog post we are sharing all of the details on how to get there, 
         when to visit, where to stay, the best activities, and more!

         We were there in February right before the whole world shut down. We were so thankful to 
         have that last trip before traveling was replaced by quarantine and shelter in place orders.
         Now as of May 1, 2021 the islands will re-open and most resorts will be welcoming guests once 
         again. When we went in February our temperatures were taken immediately upon arrival in Tahiti. 
         We were really impressed that this public health emergency was addressed there early on. Surprisingly
         enough when we returned to the US at the end of February our temperatures were not taken and there
         were no checkpoints before exiting the San Francisco airport.
        
        French Polynesia and Bora Bora in general is the perfect place to social distance and recharge after
         the last stressful year. Just imagine being on a remote island in an overwater bungalow with those 
         you love, free to jump into the ocean at your leisure. Travel will certainly look different for at 
         least the next few yers and while busy tourist destinations are mostly off limits, nature will be there for you.

        
        Getting to Bora Bora is still relatively easy, we found that there are more and more affordable flights 
        than ever before. Wherever it is you are coming from you will need to fly into Fa’a’ā International 
        Airport on the island of Tahiti. From there you can take a short flight to Bora Bora, which usually 
        takes about 50 minutes. Air France, United airlines, and Air Tahiti. Flights from Asia, Australia, 
        and Japan are expected to resume normal schedules.
        
        My husband and I opted to fly direct from San Francisco to Fa’a’ā International Airport with United 
        Airlines, and it was a great flight on a Boeing Dreamliner. We love these planes as they definitely 
        help to reduce jet leg. If you want to see our flight experience check out this YouTube video. 
        There are also a few other carriers such as Air Tahiti Nui and French Bee, a low-cost French airline
        that flies between Paris and Tahiti 2-3 times each week (with a stopover in San Francisco). 
        We stayed in Tahiti one night at the Intercontinental before taking a flight from Tahiti to 
        Bora Bora with Air Tahiti. Check out our YouTube video if you would like to see what the small 
        flight from Tahiti to Bora Bora is like.
